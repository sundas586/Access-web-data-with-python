###Sockets

Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC).
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.

A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.

Protocol = A ste of rules with which streams of data will be sent from one end to other.
IP Address = A unique IP address each time a connection is built between to ends, later it is removed.
