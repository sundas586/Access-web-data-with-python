### Sockets / TCP Connections 

Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC).
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 

![eee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33677647/193822181-5e7a3291-06cc-4204-a5e0-511a9a3a3722.PNG)

A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.

Protocol = A ste of rules with which streams of data will be sent from one end to other.

IP Address = A unique IP address each time a connection is built between to ends, later it is removed.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browse

- In HTTP it is a rule that you have to request first, you can not get responce from server before

In the following code of lines we do a HTTP request to server using python :
- Build a connection **(Socket/ TCP connection)**
- Ask the desired data through web browser **(GET REQUEST)**
- Recieve the desired data from server **(RESPONCE)**

## Unicode Characters and Strings

![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33677647/193957106-2176e8b7-9c71-43dd-9e36-b9672c17d8c3.PNG)

by default is .decode(utf-8) or .decode(ASCII) becaused utf-8 and ASCII both are compatible to each other.  
If its a old data, may be it is ASCII
If its new data, may be it is  UTF-8
As data is converted into bytes(by encoding) to travel over the internet

![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33677647/193957923-9b7a7db2-be0b-4f72-8ecd-dd4b32827634.PNG)

### ASCII AND UNICODE HISTORY

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33677647/193958017-c409f064-9684-4660-a21d-3abebe816a9f.PNG)

Computers do not understand letters, they read numbers only, so we convert the letters into a ASCII code, for computer to read the letter,
the letter "p" has a ASCII code 112.
![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33677647/193958023-330abae6-5c3f-40fb-b03f-d4d28db49468.PNG)

But ASCII code is only for English letters, to let English and Chinese computer talk over the internet,
UNICODE was desigend, as unicode has lots and lots of characters.
utf-8 and ASCII are just same and compatible
![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33677647/193958026-3c52530d-9969-4238-908c-58feb8c11210.PNG)

So, when you have a text like "Hi, this is a python3 statement \n Its october, 6:19 in the morning "
This text has only ABC, 123, \n, etc . So it is obviously ASCII code.
but when you encode it into bytes to send through internet,
and a Japanese computer recieves it,
they will use "UNICOde" to decode the English letters into there native letters.
as UNICODE has wide range of characters from several languages.

### import urllib.request

Pyhon produced urllib to make Socket and HTTP communications alot better.

### Data parsing

Data parsing is converting data from one format to another. Widely used for data structuring, it is generally done to make the existing, often unstructured, unreadable data more comprehensible. (import urllib.parser)

### Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of collecting and parsing raw data from the Web.

- Find the URL that you want to scrape.
- Inspecting the Page.
- Find the data you want to extract.
- Write the code.
- Run the code and extract the data.
- Store the data in the required format

### Beautiful Soup

The biggest problem in sraping is the parsing of the HTML that comes back as responce.
And it turns out that when your browser retrieves HTML, it goes through a whole bunch of things that effectively forgives syntax errors in HTML. 
and then you fix that. And you realize after you try to fix this and you try to parse all the links that there is just so many variations and someone has already produced a solution. And it's a library called BeautifulSoup from a place called crummy.com

**Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.**
**Hence beautiful soap is making it easy for us to parse through HTML syntax, with out using regular expression**

# WIRE PROTOCOL

**The Wire Protocol is  how the data is put on the wire, or how the data leaves one system, transits a network, and then enters another system. And in that destination system**

The basic idea is that if we've got two programs, and they're going to communicate across the Internet. One is a Python program that's producing the data. Maybe it's reading a database, maybe it's reading a file. But inside it has a Python data structure, like a dictionary. And we want to send that across the network.the network is not Python. The network is not Java. The network is a data, And the other program is in Java, perhaps, our Python dictionary in other system needs to be a Java HashMap. 
We just have to send the data to the network on a specific **format** that we all agree on. **XML** , which is one of the **wire formats**.The data which is in a Python dictionary and we covert that data into to XML then send a person across the network.

The act of going from an internal representation on one computer out to a sort of interchange format is called **serialization** format. And then the act of taking the data off of the wire and turning it into a new internal data structure, in the new environment, potentially in a very new language, is called **de-serialization**. So we take our internal structure, serialize it, send it across the network, then we receive it. We de-serialize it. and then we use it in this other programming language, in whatever structure makes sense, in that particular programming language. 
The two types of serialization formats that we're going to talk about are **XML and JSON**.

## eXtensible Markup Language (XML)

Any serialization format has some special characters and then some rules about how to form the serialized document, basically, from the internal structures.

### XML SCHEMA 

So we have two cooperating applications, and they've got to send data to one another, and they have a disagreement as to whether or not the data is right. One side might blow up or the other side might blow up and it's like whose fault is it? And so it's important to be able to define a contract as to what is acceptable XML.So this side can say I sent good stuff, and this side I received bad stuff. So you can just look at a document and you can say yes, this validates, or no, it doesn't validate. And validation is not the act of transferring the data or even deserializing the data. **Validation is the act of verifying that the data is in the right format. It's a contract.**

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33677647/194357864-a4abf8f3-5c1c-4f36-8855-685d627c1f5e.PNG)

Here we have a XML document and a XML schema contract,
the contract checks that in the document,
the outer bit of this particular XML is expected to be a tag named person and that's what that's saying. Then what it says is within that there's going to be a sequence of tags, xs:sequence. And then we basically say oh, and there's going to be a tag called lastname and it's going to be a string. And then there's going to be a tag that's age and it's going to be integer. And there's going to be a tag called dateborn and that's going to be a date. And so we can sort of look at this and say outer one person, next one in name, age, that's a number, that's good, that's a string, that's good. That looks like a date, that's good. Check, check, check, check, check. This XML matches that contract and that's the idea. then the Validator, Validates it :

The most used these days is called the **XML Schema from the World Wide Web Consortium.** It's called **XSD** and usually in the file that you get, if I just have a file and I send you the XML I have a suffix of .xml, and if I send you a schema, I tend to send you a file that's .xsd and so we kind of just call it XSD and that's the one we're going to talk about and so away we go. That's the one. 
**- Extension of XML document --> .xml**
**- Extension of XML schema contract --> .xsd**
