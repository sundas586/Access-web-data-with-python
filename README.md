### Sockets / TCP Connections 

Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC).
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.

A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.

Protocol = A ste of rules with which streams of data will be sent from one end to other.

IP Address = A unique IP address each time a connection is built between to ends, later it is removed.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browse

- In HTTP it is a rule that you have to request first, you can not get responce from server before

In the following code of lines we do a HTTP request to server using python :
- Build a connection **(Socket/ TCP connection)**
- Ask the desired data through web browser **(GET REQUEST)**
- Recieve the desired data from server **(RESPONCE)**
